Parenthood is an instinct-driven physiological experience and is the most powerful desire that exists in all the living beings that include all the creatures and people. Inability to have children, in general, is considered as a personal failure and tragedy around the world. In todays world, medical procedures like Assisted reproductive technology (ART) can help with difficulties or an inability to conceive children.

There are many IVF/ART/Testube baby centers/hospitals formulated various diagnosis and treatment options for the infertile couples. These treatment can take anywhere from months to years.

Maintaining treatment history (diagonistic report , doctor prescription, treatment plans , undergone procedure records, etc.) of a couple is very curical for hospital administration. 

In hospital, patients records are maintained by various department and departments may use software limited to their domain/department role.

A common Hospital Management Software will not only connect every department in hospital but also help to centeralised data and digitalise workflow.
