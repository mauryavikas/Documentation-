                    General background and reference&#10;information</i></b></p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>1.1 Purpose
        of this Document</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Full description of the main objectives of this SRS document
            in&#10;the context of this project</p>&#10; <p>(e.g., "This SRS describes the function and
            performance&#10;requirements allocated to the XYX system. The XYX is a stand-alone&#10;component of a
            navigation system ...")</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>1.2 Scope of the Development Project</h4>&#10;
    <blockquote>&#10; <p>Identifies the product to be developed by name and function, lists&#10;limitations (if any),
            highlights distinct features, lists benefits as&#10;clearly and precisely as possible. This will provide the
            basis for the&#10;brief description of your product.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>1.3 Definitions,
        Acronyms, and Abbreviations</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Include any specialized terminology dictated by the
            application&#10;area or the product area. This will help the reader understand the rest&#10;of the text. Be
            sure to alphabetize the terms! If this section becomes&#10;longer than one page, move the definitions, etc.
            to an appendix and&#10;provide a pointer from this section.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>1.4 References
    </h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Mention books, articles, web sites, worksheets,&#10;people who are sources of
            information about the application domain,&#10;etc. Use proper and complete reference notation. Give links
            to&#10;documents as appropriate. If this section becomes longer than one page,&#10;move the references to an
            Appendix and provide a pointer in this&#10;section. Alphabetize by last name of author. For examples,
            see&#10;documents from previous years of CS4500.<br>&#10; </p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>1.5 Overview of
        Document</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>A short yet informative description of how the rest of the SRS
            is&#10;organized and what can be found in the rest of the document. This is <b><i>not</i></b>&#10;simply a
            table of contents!! Briefly describe and motivate the various&#10;parts!</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h3>&#10;
        <hr align="left">2. General Description
    </h3>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p><b><i>Purpose of this section: an "executive overview" but
                    very&#10;client-oriented</i></b></p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>2.1 User Personas and Characteristics
    </h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>A persona is the profile of a fictional user that represents the&#10;intended
            audience(s) for this product. A persona should share&#10;characteristics with real people, but should not
            directly describe any&#10;real person. Taken together, the personas you define should represent&#10;as wide
            a variety of characteristics as possible. For this concept to&#10;be effective, your team will use these
            personas throughout the design&#10;and V&amp;V process to provide a point of reference.</p>&#10; <p>Your
            team will define a minimum of <i>two</i> personas in the&#10;SRS. The detailed descriptions will appear in
            appendices. This section&#10;of the SRS summarizes your team's personas and their characteristics.&#10;For
            example, a product for sixth graders could present personas for</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<ul>&#10; <ul>
            &#10; <li>User A, an 11-year-old power-user </li>&#10; <li>Teacher, who is relatively competent in the use
                of computers. </li>&#10; </ul>&#10;</ul>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Create the detailed description for
            each of the&#10;personas. Uniquely identify each persona, either with a descriptive&#10;label or with a
            name. If you wish, invent a picture of each persona.&#10;For each persona, describe their relevant personal
            characteristics and&#10;their general goals with respect to this product. Be sure that
            the&#10;characteristics that distinguish personas from one another are clear.&#10;If the personas are
            particularly long (e.g., a page or more each), then&#10;the detailed descriptions can be moved into an
            appendix.</p>&#10; <p>For more information on the idea of personas, see the book <i>The&#10;Inmates are
                Running the Asylum</i>by Alan Cooper.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>2.2 Product Perspective</h4>&#10;
    <ul>&#10; <li>If the product is stand-alone, give the relationship to other&#10;products. </li>&#10; <li>If the
            product is part of a larger product, then identify its&#10;interface to the other products. </li>&#10; <li>
            Identify the product's external interfaces with its environment. </li>&#10; <li>If the product uses existing
            hardware, describe the hardware. </li>&#10; <li>If the product requires new hardware, give a detailed
            explanation&#10;of the hardware. </li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<h4>2.3 Overview of Functional Requirements</h4>&#10;
    <blockquote>&#10; <p>A short description of the functions to be performed by the&#10;software, i.e., what the
            product should <em>do</em>. This description&#10;must be in a form understandable to users, operators, and
            clients. The&#10;detailed requirements specifications are left to Section 3.2 in this&#10;SRS. Number the
            Functional Requirements in a systematic manner to make&#10;it easier for you to refer to them in Section 3.2
            of the SRS, in the&#10;SDS, and in the V&amp;V documents. This section should <i>not</i>
            be&#10;design-oriented, a common mistake. </p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>2.4 Overview of Data Requirements
    </h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Describe data that are input or output from the product as well as&#10;any data that
            are stored within the system for example in files or on&#10;disk. This section should only cover data
            requirements from the user's&#10;point of view. Once again, this should not be design-oriented.</p>&#10;
    </blockquote>&#10;<h4>2.5 General Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies, Guidelines</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>
            This section describes non-functional requirements, those factors&#10;that impose constraints on the
            implementation of the software product.&#10;This can include hardware limitations or requirements, the
            amount of&#10;memory available, response times, policies, interfaces to other&#10;application software,
            networks, environmental limitations, compliance&#10;with relevant standards. This section can also provide
            guidance in&#10;situations when there may be more than one implementation strategy.</p>&#10; <p>Examples:
        </p>&#10; <blockquote>&#10; <p>"The product will only work with certain operating systems<br>&#10;"The product
                will only work within a particular network environment."<br>&#10;"The product must be
                Web-based."<br>&#10;"The product cannot require persistent data."</p>&#10; </blockquote>&#10;
    </blockquote>&#10;<h4>2.6 User View of Product Use</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>This section will provide a
            user's-eye-view of the product. Use&#10;the personas you defined in section 2.1 to make the
            descriptions&#10;concrete. Describe the setting, sketch the possible appearance of the&#10;screen(s), give
            samples of the data that is stored, entered, or output,&#10;and invent dramatic scenarios that demonstrate
            the product in&#10;operation. If this section becomes longer than about two pages, break&#10;some parts into
            Appendices and provide pointers from within the text of&#10;this section.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h3>
        &#10;
        <hr align="left">3. Specific Requirements
    </h3>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p><b><i>Purpose of this section: Technical information needed to&#10;design the
                    software</i></b></p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>3.1 External Interface Requirements</h4>&#10;<ul>
        &#10; <li>operator/user interface characteristics from the human factors&#10;point of view </li>&#10; <li>
            characteristics required of the interface between the software&#10;product and each of the hardware
            components </li>&#10; <li>interfaces with other software components or products, including&#10;other
            systems, utility software, databases, and operating systems </li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<h4>3.2 Detailed Description
        of Functional Requirements</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>This section must be customized to reflect the
            particular needs of&#10;your project. The first section should <i>always</i> be a presentation&#10;of the
            template that your team will use in defining the functional&#10;requirements. The exact categories that you
            use in your template will&#10;depend on the approach you are taking to your design.</p>&#10;</blockquote>
    &#10;<h5>3.2.1 Template for describing functional requirements</h5>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>This is a typical
            template you can use to describe each of the&#10;functional components that were identified in Section 2.3.
            These&#10;sections should be at least the following:</p>&#10; <blockquote>&#10; <table border="1"
                cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="80%">&#10; <tbody>&#10; <tr>&#10; <td width="25%"><b>purpose</b>
                        </td>&#10; <td width="75%">a description of the functional requirement&#10;and its reason(s)
                        </td>&#10; </tr>&#10; <tr>&#10; <td width="25%"><b>inputs</b></td>&#10; <td width="75%">which
                            inputs; in what form/format will inputs&#10;arrive; from what sources input will be derived,
                            legal domains of each&#10;input element</td>&#10; </tr>&#10; <tr>&#10; <td width="25%">
                            <b>processing</b></td>&#10; <td width="75%">describes the <i>outcome</i> rather than
                            the&#10; <i>implementation</i>; include any validity checks on the&#10;data, exact timing of
                            each operation (if needed), how to handle&#10;unexpected or abnormal situations</td>&#10;
                    </tr>&#10; <tr>&#10; <td width="25%"><b>outputs</b></td>&#10; <td width="75%">the form, shape,
                            destination, and volume of&#10;the output; output timing; range of parameters in the output;
                            unit&#10;measure of the output; process by which the output is stored or&#10;destroyed;
                            process for handling error messages produced as output</td>&#10; </tr>&#10; </tbody>&#10;
            </table>&#10; </blockquote>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h5>3.2.2 through 3.2.x</h5>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>The
            description of each functional requirement, using the template&#10;your team defines in section 3.2.1</p>
        &#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>3.3 Performance Requirements</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>Issues such as number of
            connections to the system, number of&#10;simultaneous users, response time, number of files, size of files
            and&#10;tables, number of files, size of files and tables, number of&#10;transactions per interval (all
            defined in terms of acceptable ranges)</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>3.4 Quality Attributes</h4>&#10;
    <blockquote>&#10; <p>Issues such as security, availability, reliability,&#10;maintainability; to these extent
            possible, these should be specified in&#10;a quantifiable way so they can be accurately measured in the
            end&#10;product.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h4>3.5 Other requirements</h4>&#10;<blockquote>&#10; <p>If there
            are no other requirements, then write "None at this time"&#10;rather than leaving this section blank.</p>
